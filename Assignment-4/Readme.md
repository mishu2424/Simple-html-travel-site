```
Create a web-based temperature converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Implement the following requirements:

HTML Structure and JavaScript Functionality:
Design a simple layout with three required elements:
input fields for entering temperatures and drop-down menu
the ‘Convert’ button for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit
display areas to show the converted temperatures and any error messages.

Implement functions to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using the conversion formulas:
Formula of temperature conversion. 
F=9/5*C+32; C=5/9*(F-32);


Dynamic Behavior:
Use event listeners to capture user actions (button clicks) dynamically and trigger the temperature conversion functions and display the converted temperatures in real time.

Control Structures:
Use control structures (if statements) to validate input by ensuring input is numeric and ensure correct conversion based on user selection. It should display appropriate error messages for invalid input.
